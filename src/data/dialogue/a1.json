Traditional Italian lasagna typically features layers of flat lasagna noodles, rag\u00f9 (a meat sauce), b\u00e9chamel sauce, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Would you like a recipe that includes all these elements, or do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences I should be aware of?",

Instead of b\u00e9chamel sauce, we can use a light ricotta cheese mixture seasoned with garlic and herbs for creaminess without the heaviness. The lasagna will still include layers of this ricotta mixture, tomato sauce, and a blend of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.

    "content": "Absolutely! For the vegetables, lightly saut\u00e9 the spinach, mushrooms, and zucchini separately with a bit of olive oil and garlic until just tender. This prevents excess moisture in the lasagna. When assembling, start with a layer of tomato sauce at the bottom of your baking dish, followed by gluten-free noodles, the ricotta mixture, vegetables, and a sprinkle of cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with cheese on top. This lasagna freezes well; just cool it completely, cover tightly, and freeze. Reheat in the oven at 350\u00b0F until thoroughly warm. Would you like any additional modifications or details?",
