To make the approach more actionable: 1) Conduct surveys to identify specific reasons behind food waste directly from students. 2) Implement a 'pre-order your lunch' program to adjust meal preparation according to real demand. 3) Organize educational workshops on food waste, teaching students about its environmental impact and how they can make a difference. 4) Set up a system for collecting unused food that is still safe to eat, and partner with local charities to distribute it. 5) Launch a composting initiative for organic waste, and use the compost for the school's garden, if available.",

Let's consider the case of Green Valley School: Green Valley School successfully reduced its food waste by 40% within the first year of implementing a comprehensive food waste reduction program. They utilized a mobile app for meal pre-orders, installed smart bins for waste tracking, and partnered with FoodRescueHero, a food donation app, to distribute surplus meals. Educational workshops were conducted both in-person and through Zoom, making it accessible to more students. The school measured its success through the data collected from smart bins and the app, showcasing a significant decrease in waste. This case demonstrates the potential of combining technology, education, and community partnerships in effectively addressing food waste in schools.",
