    "content": "It looks like there's a small mistake in your code that's causing the issue. In the line where you're calculating the average, you're using `sum` instead of `sum_numbers` to divide by `count`. The correct line should be `average = sum_numbers / count`. This will fix the error and correctly calculate the average of the numbers list.",

    "content": "Certainly! In Python, `sum` is a built-in function that's used to add up all the numbers in an iterable, like a list. When you mistakenly used `sum` instead of `sum_numbers` in the line `average = sum / count`, Python thought you were trying to use the `sum` function instead of the variable `sum_numbers` that holds the total of your numbers list. Since `sum` without parentheses is incorrect syntax for calling a function, it caused an error. By using `sum_numbers`, which is the correct variable that stores the sum of the numbers in your list, you're correctly dividing the total sum by the count of numbers to find the average, thus fixing the error.",
