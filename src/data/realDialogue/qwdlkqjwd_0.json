    "content": "Hi, please check this paragraph: \n\nLLM-powered conversational interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT and Gemini) have been supporting iterative text generations, allowing users to generate satisfying texts through a series of follow-up instructions. Despite their flexibility and ease of use, replicating such iterative text generation tasks in different contexts is an inefficient and cumbersome process, with users having to repeatedly specify their requirements in varying situations. To address the challenge, we introduce the concept of extit{GPT shortcuts}, which learn a reusable function from a user dialogue. The goal of GPT shortcut is to learn users' text generation process from dialogues and apply the learned patterns for consistent text generations in different contexts. As a novel technique of GPT shortcut generation, we introduce VOI prompting, which constructs user instructions in three dimensions - Voice, Organization, and Idea dimensions from the six traits of writing framework - from a user dialogue and performs one-shot learning with the extracted instructions. Our quantitative evaluation results show that VOI prompting consistently generates texts that address user instructions specified in the dialogue. In addition, we report an in-depth ablation study using synthetic datasets, which justifies the design decision behind the VOI prompting technique.",

    "content": "Your paragraph presents an interesting concept and is mostly well-constructed. However, there are a couple of technical corrections and suggestions to improve clarity:\n\n1. In the given LaTeX command `\\extit{GPT shortcuts}`, it looks like there’s a typo. It should likely be `\\textit{GPT shortcuts}` to italicize \"GPT shortcuts\" in a LaTeX document.\n2. The description of \"GPT shortcuts\" and \"VOI prompting\" could be slightly rephrased for better clarity.\n3. Be consistent with terminology, define acronyms, and ensure singular and plural forms are correct.\n\nHere's a revised version of the paragraph:\n\nLanguage model-powered conversational interfaces, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, have facilitated iterative text generation, allowing users to produce satisfactory texts through a series of follow-up instructions. Despite their flexibility and ease of use, applying these iterative generation tasks across different contexts remains an inefficient and cumbersome process; users are required to restate their needs for each new situation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the concept of \\textit{GPT shortcuts}, which aim to learn a reusable pattern from user dialogues. The objective is for \\textit{GPT shortcuts} to capture the user's text generation process from their dialogues and utilize the learned patterns to consistently generate text across various contexts. As a cutting-edge method for creating these shortcuts, we propose the VOI (Voice, Organization, and Idea) prompting technique. This method extracts instructions along three dimensions—based on the six traits of the writing framework—from user dialogues and applies one-shot learning with these tailored prompts. Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates that VOI prompting reliably produces text aligned with users' instructions detailed in the dialogues. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive ablation study using synthetic datasets that supports the rationale behind the development of the VOI prompting technique.\n\nThis edited paragraph provides a clearer outline of the objectives and findings of your work while correcting LaTeX formatting and improving general readability.",
