      "Imagine you're managing a space mission to explore distant galaxies. Your spacecraft requires a blend of rare elements for its propulsion system. Element X, priced at $3.5 million per gram, and Element Y, priced at $2.8 million per gram, are crucial components. The spacecraft's engine consumes 300 grams of Element X and 500 grams of Element Y for each interstellar jump. Your mission plan entails conducting 50 jumps in total. To ensure budgetary feasibility, you aim for a unit cost per jump and a profit margin of 40%. What should be the manufacturing cost per jump?"

    "content": "To calculate the manufacturing cost per bottle, we first need to understand the costs and quantities of the ingredients used per bottle. \n\nWe need to calculate the cost of horse placenta and fingerroot required for each pill and then multiply it by the number of pills per bottle.\n\n**Cost of horse placenta per pill:**\n\nHorse placenta cost = 1.8 million won/kg\nSince there are 1,000,000 mg in a kg, the cost per mg is:\nCost per mg = 1,800,000 won/kg / 1,000,000 mg/kg\nCost per mg = 1.8 won/mg\n\nEach pill contains 500 mg of horse placenta:\nCost per pill for horse placenta = 500 mg * 1.8 won/mg\nCost per pill for horse placenta = 900 won\n\n**Cost of fingerroot per pill:**\n\nFingerroot cost = 2.2 million won/10 kg\nCost per kg = 2,200,000 won / 10 kg\nCost per kg = 220,000 won/kg\n\nAgain, since there are 1,000,000 mg in a kg, the cost per mg is:\nCost per mg = 220,000 won/kg / 1,000,000 mg/kg\nCost per mg = 0.22 won/mg\n\nEach pill contains 500 mg of fingerroot:\nCost per pill for fingerroot = 500 mg * 0.22 won/mg\nCost per pill for fingerroot = 110 won\n\n**Total ingredient cost per pill:**\nTotal cost per pill = Cost per pill for horse placenta + Cost per pill for fingerroot\nTotal cost per pill = 900 won + 110 won\nTotal cost per pill = 1,010 won\n\n**Total ingredient cost per bottle (90 pills):**\nTotal cost per bottle = Total cost per pill * 90 pills per bottle\nTotal cost per bottle = 1,010 won/pill * 90 pills/bottle\nTotal cost per bottle = 90,900 won\n\nNow, let's incorporate the desired margin rate to find the target selling price. The margin is the percentage of the selling price, so we have the following relation:\n\nSelling Price = Manufacturing Cost + (Margin Rate * Selling Price)\n\nWe're targeting a margin rate of 30%, so let M be the manufacturing cost per bottle and SP be the selling price.\n\n1.30 * M = SP \n\nGiven that the SP needs to cover the ingredient cost (which is part of the manufacturing cost) plus the desired margin, we set \n\n1.30 * M = SP >= 90,900 won\n\nTo find the manufacturing cost M, we can rearrange the equation to solve for M:\n\nM = SP / 1.30\n\nNow, we don't have the selling price, but we know that the ingredient cost is a part of the manufacturing cost and must be below it. Since we want a 30% margin on the manufacturing cost, the ingredient cost should be no more than 70% of the manufacturing cost (the cost without the profit margin), which aligns with our previous equation:\n\n0.70 * M = 90,900 won\n\nWe can now solve for M:\n\nM = 90,900 won / 0.70\nM = 129,857.14 won\n\nThe manufacturing cost per bottle (M), before accounting for the profit margin, should be approximately 129,857 won to achieve a 30% margin based on the costs of the ingredients. However, please note that this manufacturing cost only accounts for the ingredients and does not include other costs such as packaging, labor, quality control, overhead, marketing, and distribution, which should also be factored into the total manufacturing cost to calculate the final sale price of the product.",
